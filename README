These are some scripts I use with mitmproxy.

They are meant to be used like:

mitmproxy \
  -s 'jq.py /repos "[.[0] | .stargazers_count = 1000]"' \
  -s 'mock.py funnyname test.response'

So that api.github.com/users/psycotica0/repos will only have one item which has a
high stargazer's count.

api.github.com/users/psycotica0/funnyname will return whatever's in test.response with hitting github's servers.

jq.py requires jq.
